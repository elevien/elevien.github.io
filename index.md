# About me


I am an applied mathematician, interested in stochastic processes, applied statistics and biology. I do [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hshuLN4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [teach](./teaching.html) at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/) in New Hampshire.


# Opportunities

I anticipate having openings for graduate students and a postdoc over the next year. Please get in-touch if you are interested!
